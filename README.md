# Smart-Lock-System-Facial-Recognition
The "Smart Lock System - Facial Recognition" project utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller and a webcam to implement a facial recognition system. Users are enrolled in the system by capturing their faces, and the facial recognition model on the ESP32 identifies authorized users, granting them access to the secured area. The project offers a contactless and secure access control solution for various applications.
